Given a string of open and closed brackets output "Balanced" if the 
brackets are balanced or "Unbalanced" otherwise.

A string is balanced if it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing 
brackets (in that order), none of which mis-nest.

Expected complexity: O(N)

Example input:
(())())

Example output:
Unbalanced

Example input:
(()())

Example output:
Balanced
