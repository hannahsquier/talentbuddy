Given an array of integer numbers your task is to print to the standard output 
(stdout) the majority number.

One number is considered majority if it occurs more than N / 2 times in an array of size N.

Note: If no number is majority then print "None"

Expected complexity: O(N) time, O(1) memory

Example input:
1 1 2 3 4 1 6 1 7 1 1

Example output:
1

Example input:
1 2 2 3

Example output:
None
